							<h2>RIDE WITHOUT WORRY</h2>	
							<p>
								One common question many working professionals have about public transportation is what they will do when life’s little emergencies arise. How will they get home without a car if they have a sick child or have to work late?
							</p>
							<p>
								Well, worry no more: The Emergency Ride Home program is the answer to your public transportation concerns. If at least two days a week you ride the bus, vanpool or carpool (or even ride a bicycle or walk), you can take up to 4 free taxi rides each year in cases of personal illness, family emergency or unexpected overtime. (Some restrictions apply; please call for details.)

								By using another mode of transportation, rather than driving alone, you are reducing traffic and parking congestion, curbing auto emissions and improving the quality of life in our community. By providing incentives like the Emergency Ride Home Program, we hope to encourage everyone to commute the smart way!

										<h2>BETTER COMMUNTES WITH VANPOOL</h2>
										<p>
											Discover the comfort, convenience and savings of a vanpool—the smart way to carpool. A vanpool is a group of eight employees riding together in a van on their daily commute to and from work. One member of the group drives and picks up the other group members at their residences or a common pickup area. A <span class="nowrap">back-up</span> driver is always available in case the regular driver goes on vacation or gets sick. <a href="#" class="link-colored">TBARTA</a> operates this vanpool service and provides the van. Vanpooling operates on a monthly basis, so you never have to make a long-term commitment
										</p>
										<p>
											Each passenger pays a monthly fare, which covers the cost of maintenance and insurance, and shares the gas cost. Thanks to government funding, fares are low, and you save significantly over the cost of driving alone. Plus, vanpoolers are eligible for the Emergency Ride Home program, which provides individual transportation for emergencies and unexpected overtime.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="half-column vanpool-data-last">
									<div>
										<h2>COMMUTING WITH COMFORT AND RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
										<p>
											People who vanpool to work arrive more relaxed and are less stressed than their co-workers who drive alone. When not behind the wheel, you can use this time to read, sleep or catch up on paperwork. The vans are equipped with air-conditioning, individual reading lights, plenty of legroom and other features that make your ride more comfortable. And because vanpools are organized according to where you live and work, you'll be riding with friends, neighbors and colleagues.
										</p>
										<p>
											Vanpools also help reduce the congestion on the roadways. If there are eight people in your vanpool, that's seven fewer cars on the road. You'll enjoy your commute knowing that you are improving traffic conditions and helping reduce pollution.
										</p>
										<p>
											Does your employer know that your company can subsidize your vanpool commute while reducing its taxable income? Under the Comprehensive National Energy Policy Act, effective January 1, 1993, employers can give their employees up to $115 a month tax free for vanpooling.
