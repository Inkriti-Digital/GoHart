											If the nature or volume of public records requested to be inspected, examined, or copied is such as to require extensive use of information technology resources, or extensive clerical or supervisory assistance by HART personnel, the requestor will be charged the least costly fully-burdened hourly pay of an administrative assistant or staff person, and/or special service charges which are based on the actual cost incurred for the extensive use of resources in furnishing or copying the information requested. The special service charges apply to requests for both inspection and copies of public records. If the total estimated cost for requests is $49 or less, payment can be obtained at the time the documents are picked up or mailed. If the total estimated cost for requests is $50 or more, payment must be received before the records are copied.
